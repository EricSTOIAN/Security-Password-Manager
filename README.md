# Password Manager 🖥️🔒

<p>This is a project a few of my friends and I made during the school year, related to our recently finished security classes. It involves creating passwords and encrypting them using different types of encryption algorithms.</p>

## Description

<p>Are you in need of a password manager that makes sure the passowrds you set are safely encrypted using different algorithms? This is what you need! This project tracks the passwords you set, making sure you let it know what each password is used for,
in a dictionary-like fashion. After having typed out your desired password, choose between three encryption algorithms and your password is now safe! Using Fernet, RSA and AES techniques, your password will remain unattainable to anyone else!</p>
